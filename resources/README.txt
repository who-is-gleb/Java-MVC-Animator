------------------
Changes from last assignment:

- Fixed Java style for large portions of the code, notably in declareShape in the Builder by
  removing a switch statement

- Added toggleLooping(), togglePlayback(), restart(), increaseRate(), decreaseRate(), and
  setListener() to the view interface. These are needed by the new view and controller to make
  interacting with the view possible.
