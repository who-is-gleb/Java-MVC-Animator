# Java-MVC-Animator
Hello! Here is an example of our Java application that is capable of creating animations.

This is the project that me and my partner created during our OOD class at Northeastern University. 
You can launch it by creating a jar file and running the file with command-line arguments. 
E.g. "java -in in.txt -out out.txt -view svg"
